# Library

Library project created using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The books are stored inside an array, and displayed in the DOM using createBook(recievedBook) function each time a change takes place (adding a new book to the library, removing a book from the library, changing a book's read status). Books information (coming from user inputs) are stored in a Book object.
